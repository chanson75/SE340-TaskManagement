Current Status: Still having pgadmin issue for not being able to create the server. Fixed the frontend issue for not being able to see anything. Weird issue with frontend with not being able to input anything into the fields, will explore eventually.

Steps to run:
- Download as zip file
- Extract to a folder
- Open in VS Code
- Run docker-compose up -d
- Open localhost:3000 for frontend, localhost:5050 for pgadmin.
- Email is admin@admin.com, password is admin for pgadmin
- Create new server, host name is db, username should be postgres, password should be postgres. //This is where I'm at currently, might look into working on the frontend part.
