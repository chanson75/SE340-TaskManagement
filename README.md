Current Status: WE ARE WORKING, just lots of hoops to go through, I will demo on my system when we present. Had to take a more separated approach to this project. I got a lot of weird issues stemming from Docker and not sure what else. I might try to have this run on docker, but for now, I am good with what I have. Next time we meet I will show y'all everything that needed to happen. Also going to look at how to apply the architecture a bit better in the code.
