Current Status: WE ARE WORKING, just lots of hoops to go through, I will demo on my system when we present. Had to take a more separated approach to this project. I got a lot of weird issues stemming from Docker and not sure what else. I might try to have this run on docker, but for now, I am good with what I have. Next time we meet I will show y'all everything that needed to happen. Also going to look at how to apply the architecture a bit better in the code.

UPDATE: I applied some better architecture principles by splitting up the different pages and styling files into separate files apart from the main App.js and App.css files. I will work on a walkthrough to set this stuff up on your local machines to run on Sunday the 8th of December 2024. If anyone has any styling suggestions, please let me know. Otherwise, I think the system as a whole is working pretty well.

ANOTHER UPDATE: I added some new functionality, mainly the option to edit tasks, along with some different files.
